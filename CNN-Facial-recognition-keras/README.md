# Facial recognition by convolutional neural network ([Notebook part1](https://github.com/llAamirll/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/CNN-Facial-recognition-keras/Preprocessing_CNN_Indian_Actors_Face_Recognition.ipynb)-[Notebook part2](https://github.com/llAamirll/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/CNN-Facial-recognition-keras/Facial_recognition_keras.ipynb))

## Project detail

-**About data** Indian Actors Face Recognition is [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shubham2003/indian-actors-face-recognition) .The dataset includes images of 5 famous Indian film stars. The dataset has been made smaller .The .zip files contain 5 directories and each of them has 30 images of actors.The second zip file contains validation images so that we can evaluate your model.

- **Steps** 
This project divided into two parts .
[Notebook part1](https://github.com/llAamirll/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/CNN-Facial-recognition-keras/Preprocessing_CNN_Indian_Actors_Face_Recognition.ipynb)
1. Getting libraries
2. Renaming the filenames and save to one place
3. Save filename with their corresponding label in pandas

*Tools - cv2, pandas, os* 

[Notebook part2](https://github.com/llAamirll/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/CNN-Facial-recognition-keras/Facial_recognition_keras.ipynb)

1. Importing libaries and label file
2. Creating functions for image manipulation
3. Prepare the data to feed into model
4. Buliding the model
5. Train the Model
6. Test image on new images

*Tools - numpy ,pandas,tqdm, cv2 , dlib ,matplotlib,keras,ImageDataGenerator*
